# Martingale_Problem
## Casino strategy
There is a strategy that some gamblers uses when in a casino.
<p>It goes by after a loss, they double the bet on the next attempt.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>After a loss of 25$, the next bet would be a value of 50$. And if they continue to lose, they would continue to double it down until they win a hand.</p>
<p>The problem with that strategie, is that we often underestimate the chance of a losing streak to happen.</p>

<p>The script I wrote, shows the chance of a streak happening considering you're flipping a coin 200 times</p>
